# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.

We're going to take the following approach:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
